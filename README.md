## What is CHATAFISHA?

CHATAFISHA is a decentralized coordination engine for the empowerment of communities in Africa through the use of blockchain technology. 

The platform creates decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that facilitate the development of human capital and the re-definition of public spaces, with the goal of fostering social and economic growth in Africa.

 Through the use of DAOs, CHATAFISHA aims to empower communities to self-govern and drive their own development, leading to a more equitable and prosperous society.

## What is ChataDAO?

A CHATAFISHA DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is a type of organization that exists on the blockchain and is governed democratically by its members. CHATAFISHA creates DAOs as a way to empower communities in Africa and facilitate the development of human capital and the re-definition of public spaces. DAOs allow communities to self-govern and make decisions about how the organization is run, enabling them to drive their own development and bring about positive change in their region. Through the use of DAOs, CHATAFISHA aims to foster social and economic growth in Africa.

## **Why should I  join CHATAFISHA?**

There are many reasons for everyone to join CHATAFISHA. We are:

- **Radically purposeful:** Doing what is right is at the core. We speak and act with candid care and purpose. Feedback is sharp, yet thoughtful.
